Four key issues in Buddhist philosophy, impermanence, suffering, emptiness and nirvana, are critically examined by Gen Lamrimpa. He offers fresh and profound insights. He was educated at Drepung Loseling Monastic College in Tibet until the old order was swept away in 1959. In spite of tremendous difficulties he did not flee but remained in Tibet till he died in 1997, aged 75. <a class="publication-single__link" title="Czech translation of a Glowing Light of Scripture and Reasoning" href="{{ site.url }}/files/CtyriPecetiText_final-Czech.pdf">Czech translation available to download here.</a>
