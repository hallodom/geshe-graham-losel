I wrote these verses as an introduction to A Glowing Light of Scripture and Reasoning, a survey of the four seals of Buddhist philosophy by Gen Lamrimpa Ngawang Phuntsok. Particularly helpful are his presentations of the proof of subtle impermanence and how understanding subtle impermanence is the key to understanding subtle suffering. My translation of his text is available as a free download from this website. Its full title is [A Glowing Light of Scripture and Reasoning, Lamp Illuminating the Essentials of the Four Seals](/publications/book/a-glowing-scripture-and-reasoning/) that Authenticate the View. There's also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wUDzteTCw" class="publication-link">video recording</a> available.
