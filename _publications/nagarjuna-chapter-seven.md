Arising, lasting and destruction are the three characteristics of composites/ compounded phenomena/ the conditioned. N훮g훮rjuna's verses are a relentless critique of various wrong views of these three qualities. The verses are extremely condensed and hard to understand on their own without commentary. But they are beautiful to hear chanted, and to chant!
