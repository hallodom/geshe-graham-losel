The precious opportunity of our unpredictable and fleeting visit here in this life must not be wasted. Yet, under the dark spell of self-grasping ignorance, we remain blind to our unlimited evolutionary potential. The eloquent words of Tsongkhapa's song, Praise for  Dependent Relativity are a cascade of moonbeams to dispel that inner obscurity and light the path to highest enlightenment. Gen Lobsang Gyatso's commentary lays out Tsongkhapa's praise for Buddha's  magnificent and profound integration of the surface and ultimate levels of reality with explanations and examples entirely relevant to life in today's world.
