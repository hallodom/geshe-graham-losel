Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) was one of Tibet’s most outstanding and revered scholar-saints. The first Dalai Lama was one of his direct students. Tsongkhapa’s especial emphasis on dependent arising gave a new turn to the interpretation of Buddhist philosophy, in particular to the philosophy of the Middle Way school associated with Nagarjuna. That is first signalled in this poem, composed on the very morning that he definitively entered into the subtlest understanding of the ultimate view of emptiness. Commentary by Lobsang Gyatso, founder of the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics, Dharamsala, India. My translation of Tsongkhapa’s verses only is available.
