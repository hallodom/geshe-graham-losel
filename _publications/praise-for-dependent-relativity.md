Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) wrote Praise for Dependent Relativity on the morning that he first developed the wisdom realizing the final view, antidote to all the troubles of the world. The essence of this view is the harmony of dependent arising and emptiness. Recommended commentary, Tsongkhapa’s Praise for Dependent Relativity by Lobsang Gyatso and Graham Woodhouse, Wisdom Publications.
