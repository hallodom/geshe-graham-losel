The Land of Bodhicitta is a poetic journey exploring the path of awakening through compassion and wisdom. Written in contemplative verse, it weaves together imagery of landscapes both inner and outer, as metaphors for the spiritual journey toward enlightened mind. The poem reflects on the cultivation of bodhicitta - the wish to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings - through vivid natural imagery and heartfelt aspirational verses. Amid the Earth's beauty and impermanence, itâ€™s a call to embrace wisdom, compassion, and the precious chance to grow.
