Classic Indian Buddhist texts often begin with a verse of homage in which the author bows down before his chosen object of devotion, seeking inspiration for his endeavours. The three texts here are studied by all traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and have a wide, enduring fame. Their homages are often chanted at the beginning of Buddhist teachings in the Tibetan style.
