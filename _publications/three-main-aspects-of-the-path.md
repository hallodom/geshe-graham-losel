The Three Main Aspects of the Path was written in response to a request from one of Je Rinpoche's close disciples Tsakho Önpo Ngawang Drakpa who had been his first attendant and who was then in Gyalmorong, Eastern Tibet. Je Rinpoche promised him that if he followed his instructions well, when he, Tsongkhapa, became a Buddha, he would share the first nectar of his teaching with him. In the final verse of the text the reference to ‘child’, can be taken to include all of us too. The three main aspects of the path are the determination to be free, the awakening mind of bodhichitta and the correct view of emptiness.
