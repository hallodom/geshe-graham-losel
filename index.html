    <h4 class="about-title">About</h4>
    <p class="about-text">
      Geshe Tenzin Losel was born in mid-20th century Britain. He first met
      Buddhist teachings in England thanks to the exceptionally kind efforts of
      <a href="https://fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe/" class="name">Lama Yeshe</a>
      and
      <a href="https://fpmt.org/teachers/zopa/" class="name">Lama Zopa</a>
      , reaching out to westerners.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      He left for India in 1990 for further studies and received full ordination
      as a Buddhist monk in the Tibetan tradition from
      <a href="https://www.dalailama.org/" class="name">
        His Holiness the Dalai Lama
      </a>
      in 1994. He is one of the handful of Westerners trained for two decades in
      the traditional Tibetan way as a geshe. While a student at the Institute
      of Buddhist Dialectics in Dharamsala, he attended many public teachings by
      His Holiness there.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      In 2006 he received his geshe degree from Drepung Loseling, the monastery
      where the late
      <a href="https://lamrimbristol.org.uk/about/geshe-damcho" class="name">
        Geshe Damcho
      </a>
      , founder of
      <a href="https://www.lamrimcentre.org.uk">Lam Rim Wales</a>
      also trained. After returning to Britain to care for his parents in their
      last years, he moved in 2018 to Nalanda Monastery in France.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      As well as teaching, he has been involved in translating vinaya materials,
      which deal with ethical conduct and vows, especially for monastics. In
      fulfilment of
      <a href="https://lamrimbristol.org.uk/about/geshe-damcho" class="name">
        Geshe Damcho's
      </a>
      request to him to teach in his centres, he is now also associated with
      <a href="https://www.lamrimcentre.org.uk">Lam Rim Wales</a>
      and Lam Rim Bristol.
