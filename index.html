    <p class="about-text">
      Geshe Losel is a graduate of the Institute of Dialectics in Dharamsala,
      India and studied there under the famous scholar Gen Lobsang Gyatso. A
      British monk, Graham Woodhouse is one of the very few Westerners trained
      in the traditional Tibetan way as a geshe. He received his geshe degree
      from Drepung Loseling Monastic College. He has knowledge of the texts,
      skill in translating, and an ability to convey the subtleties of Buddhist
      thought in lucid English. He lives at Nalanda Monastery, a branch of the
      Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, in the south of
      France.
