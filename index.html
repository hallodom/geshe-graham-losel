    <h4 class="about-title">About</h4>
    <p class="about-text">
      Geshe Tenzin Losel was born in mid-20th century Britain. He first met
      Buddhist teachings in England thanks to the exceptionally kind efforts of
      <a href="https://fpmt.org/teachers/yeshe/" class="name">Lama Yeshe</a>
      and
      <a href="https://fpmt.org/teachers/zopa/" class="name">Lama Zopa</a>
      , reaching out to westerners.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      He left for India in 1990 for further studies and received full ordination
      as a Buddhist monk in the Tibetan tradition from
      <a href="https://www.dalailama.org/" class="name">
        His Holiness the Dalai Lama
      </a>
      in 1994. He is one of the handful of Westerners trained for two decades in
      the traditional Tibetan way as a geshe. While a student at the Institute
      of Buddhist Dialectics in Dharamsala, he attended many public teachings by
      His Holiness there.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      In 2006 he received his geshe degree from Drepung Loseling, the monastery
      where the late
      <a href="https://lamrimbristol.org.uk/about/geshe-damcho" class="name">
        Geshe Damcho
      </a>
      , founder of
      <a href="https://www.lamrimcentre.org.uk">Lam Rim Wales</a>
      also trained. After returning to Britain to care for his parents in their
      last years, he moved in 2018 to Nalanda Monastery in France.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      As well as teaching, he has been involved in translating vinaya materials,
      which deal with ethical conduct and vows, especially for monastics. In
      fulfilment of
      <a href="https://lamrimbristol.org.uk/about/geshe-damcho" class="name">
        Geshe Damcho's
      </a>
      request to him to teach in his centres, he is now also associated with
      <a href="https://www.lamrimcentre.org.uk">Lam Rim Wales</a>
      and Lam Rim Bristol.

          The Four Noble Truths – an Introduction to Buddha's Teachings
        </p>
        <p class="event-description">
          What to make of this life chance of ours? Its beauty is fragile, happiness alternates with suffering, gain with loss, but are these uncertainties inevitable? We were born to be curious. Spend time to hear what Buddha did to find tranquillity, fulfilment and abundance by exploring his first teaching of all, on the Four Truths. Wisdom is an inner quality; loving kindness is an inner quality. Their seeds are within us now. The path to the best of peace and joy for ourselves and others is a case of nurturing our natural mental potential.
